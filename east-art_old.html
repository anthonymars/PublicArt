          <h4>21 East End Artist Bricks Project - Various Artists</h4>
          <small>2010 1500 block of Washington Street East between Nancy and Maxwell Streets</small>
          <p>The East End of Charleston 2010 is home to many artists, who have been commissioned to improve the streetscape. In addition to these unique bricks, artists painted murals and designed banners for this neighborhood.</p>
          <p>Shown here clockwise from upper left: Charles Jupiter Hamilton, Rudy Panucci, Joe Bolyard, and Heidi Richardson Evans.</p>

          <small>2008 1588 Washington Street East</small>
          <p>This mural has painted and stained glass components designed by the artist. The central figure, which seems to be standing on a brick-paved street, is flanked by a pair of dogs and several stars.</p>

          <h4>23 Out and About - Rob Cleland</h4>
          <small>1988 Clay Center, Lee Street and Brooks Streets</small>
          <p>This artist finds inspiration in the figure. In this mural, the artist’s first, he depicts “the flavor of the East End” through people he encountered in the community. Some of the artist’s favorites are the two brothers in the lower left who served as a self-appointed welcoming committee waving at passersby. Do you recognize any East End neighbors?</p>

          <p>Dogs, cats, birds, and other creatures are having quite a time dining out, and not on each other, in this mural. The image is reminiscent of neighboring restaurants and pubs.</p>

          <p>West Virginia, a border state and part of the Union, was subject to raids by the Confederates. The Capitol Complex includes sculptures that commemorate both Union and Confederate forces..</p>

          <small>1936, 1974 State Capitol Complex South Entrance, on Kanawha Boulevard East</small>
          <p>This contemplative sculpture of Lincoln, America’s sixteenth President, depicts him facing south, wearing a long robe. Torrey was inspired by the poem Lincoln Walks at Midnight by the poet Vachel Lindsay when he created a model for the sculpture. The model was enlarged by Wiepper and cast in bronze to celebrate West Virginia’s 111th birthday.</p>

          <h4>28 Capitol Faces - John Donnelly, Sr.</h4>
          <small>1924 - 1930 The Capitol Building, Kanawha Boulevard East</small>
          <p>Twelve carved mythological figures look out from the keystone position over the arched entrances into the Capitol Building. The figures on the east wing are Hera, Prometheus, and Perseus. Over the east entrance into the main building are Mercury, Vulcan, and Minerva. Over the west entrance to the main building are Vesta, Neptune, and Ceres. Fortuna, Jupiter, and Hercules are located above the entrance to the building’s west wing. Note the details that distinguish these figures from each other.</p>
          <p>The artist also designed the bronze doors at the United States Supreme Court Building in Washington, DC, in collaboration with his son John Donnelly, Jr.</p>

        <img class="img img-responsive" src="img/eastend/stonewall.jpg" alt="Stonewall">
          <h4>29 Stonewall Jackson - Sir Moses Jacob Ezekiel</h4>
          <small>1909 State Capitol Complex, facing Kanawha Boulevard, near California Street</small>
          <p>Thomas Jonathan “Stonewall” Jackson was born in 1824 in what is now Clarksburg, West Virginia. He became a Confederate general during the Civil War, and this sculpture was commissioned by the Daughters of the Confederacy. It was moved to this location when the original Capitol Building burned in 1921. After serving in the Confederate States Army, the American artist lived in Rome, where this sculpture was cast. The high plinth makes observing the details of this sculpture difficult. Why do you think the artist chose such a high plinth?</p>

          <small>1979 State Capitol Complex, 1900 Kanawha Boulevard East, West Wing of Building 1 facing north</small>
          <p>Booker T. Washington lived in the Kanawha Valley of West Virginia from the age of nine to sixteen. This bust was originally made of granite and located west of Malden, West Virginia just miles from the Capitol. It was restored by Hopen and moved to the Capitol grounds in 1979. The artist chose to cast the bust in bronze, placing his original drawings and designs inside the object. The bust is located on its original granite base, created in 1963.</p>

          <h4>34 West Virginia Veterans’ Memorial - P. Joseph Mullins</h4>
          <small>1996 State Capitol Complex, between the Washington Street East gate house and Building 3</small>
          <p>The artist won the 1987 design competition to create this memorial. The design integrates the bronze figures into an architectural environment. The interior walls include the names of West Virginians who lost their lives in U.S. wars of the 20th century. The figures include an infantryman from WWI, a sailor from WWII, an airman from the Korean War, and a marine from the Vietnam War. The artist conducted extensive research to ensure accuracy in the figures’ clothing and weapons.</p>

          <h4>35 West Virginia’s Female Veterans Memorial - P. Joseph Mullins</h4>
          <small>2011 State Capitol Complex, between Building 3 and the West Virginia Veterans’ Memorial</small>
          <p>The figurative sculpture and bronze plaques that constitute this work are the first memorial to honor female soldiers in West Virginia. In addition, this is the only sculpture depicting a woman on the capitol grounds. It was controversial when installed because some felt that it did not depict female veterans of all eras. Mullins chose to represent a female veteran of the Iraqi and Afghanistan wars. Her attire does not represent any particular branch of the service. At about eight feet tall, she stands at eye level with her comrades-in-arms in the Veterans’ Memorial.</p>

          <small>2002 State Capitol Complex, between the West wing of Building 1 and the visitor’s metered parking lot, accessed via Greenbrier Street and Washington Street East</small>
          <p>This sculpture served as a gathering place during the Upper Big Branch mine disaster in 2010. It continues to be the location where people come to remember the twenty-nine men who lost their lives in that explosion.</p>

         <img class="img img-responsive" src="img/eastend/spiritwv.jpg" alt="Spirit">
          <h4>37 Spirit of West Virginia - James Edward Lykins</h4>
          <small>1950 State Capitol Complex, State Office Building 3, Main Entrance Washington Street</small>
          <p>The figure in this relief stands near a rhododendron bush, West Virginia’s state flower. She is surrounded by smaller scenes that depict different industries including farming, timber, and steel. The text beneath her is the state motto in Latin: “Mountaineers Are Always Free.” The artist worked as a painter and a sculptor on many public commissions including the pediment figures at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.</p>
        <br> <hr>
         <img class="img img-responsive" src="img/eastend/moses.jpg" alt="Moses">
          <h4>38 Moses Before the Burning Bush - Milton Horn</h4>
          <small>1960 Temple B’Nai Israel 2312 Kanawha Boulevard East</small>
          <p>The relief depicts the Biblical story of Moses and the burning bush. Beneath the relief are rows of bronze Hebrew letters. Rabbi James Cohn described the text, from Exodus 3:14 as, “Ehyeh asher ehyeh, a phrase often rendered in English, “I am that I am.” However, we do not know what the words were meant to convey. They can be translated just as easily, “I am what I am” or “I will be what I will be” or “I will be who I will be” or “I shall prove to be whatsoever I shall prove to be” or even “I will be because I will be.” The reference in Hebrew to God’s name cannot be confidently translated into English.</p>

          <h4>39 Sound and Beyond - Dr. Cubert Smith</h4>
          <small>1989 Yeager Airport, Airport Road, Right of Entrance</small>
          <p>The aluminum used in this sculpture suggests the materials used in airplanes. Chuck Yeager for whom the Charleston airport is named was the first to break the sound barrier. The sculpture asks the viewer to consider what might be possible in flight after the sound barrier was broken.</p>
          <p>In addition to his work as a sculptor, the artist is a well-known community leader and educator who has created works of public art across West Virginia.</p>
